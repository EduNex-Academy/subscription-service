# Complete Endpoint Database Updates

## What Happens When You Call `/complete`

When you call `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/complete`, the backend now performs the following database updates:

### 1. User Subscription Record Creation ✅
- Creates a complete `UserSubscription` record in the database
- Maps all Stripe subscription data to local database fields:
  - `userId` → Current authenticated user
  - `stripeSubscriptionId` → Stripe subscription ID
  - `stripeCustomerId` → Stripe customer ID
  - `status` → Mapped from Stripe status (ACTIVE, PENDING, etc.)
  - `startDate` → From Stripe current period start
  - `endDate` → From Stripe current period end
  - `autoRenew` → Based on Stripe cancellation settings
  - `planId` → Links to subscription plan

### 2. Payment Record Creation ✅
- Creates a `Payment` record in the database with:
  - `userId` → Current authenticated user
  - `subscriptionId` → Links to the created subscription
  - `amount` → Plan price
  - `currency` → USD (or plan currency)
  - `status` → Mapped from Stripe payment status:
    - `COMPLETED` → When Stripe payment succeeded
    - `PENDING` → When payment is processing
    - `FAILED` → When payment failed
  - `stripePaymentIntentId` → Stripe payment intent ID
  - `stripeInvoiceId` → Stripe invoice ID
  - `paymentMethod` → "STRIPE"
  - `createdAt` → Automatically set

### 3. Points Awarding ✅
- If subscription status is `ACTIVE`, automatically awards points:
  - Points amount from subscription plan
  - Description: "Subscribed to [Plan Name] plan"
  - Transaction type: "SUBSCRIPTION"
  - Links to subscription ID

## Database Tables Updated

### `user_subscriptions` Table
```sql
INSERT INTO user_subscriptions (
    id, user_id, plan_id, 
    stripe_subscription_id, stripe_customer_id,
    status, start_date, end_date, auto_renew,
    created_at, updated_at
) VALUES (...);
```

### `payments` Table
```sql
INSERT INTO payments (
    id, user_id, subscription_id,
    amount, currency, status,
    payment_method, stripe_payment_intent_id, stripe_invoice_id,
    created_at
) VALUES (...);
```

### `points_transactions` Table (if subscription is active)
```sql
INSERT INTO points_transactions (
    id, user_id, points_amount, 
    transaction_type, description,
    related_subscription_id, created_at
) VALUES (...);
```

### `user_points_wallets` Table (updated)
```sql
UPDATE user_points_wallets 
SET current_balance = current_balance + points_awarded,
    total_earned = total_earned + points_awarded,
    last_updated = NOW()
WHERE user_id = ?;
```

## Payment Status Mapping

### From Stripe Payment Intent:
- `succeeded` → `COMPLETED`
- `processing` → `PENDING`
- `requires_payment_method` → `PENDING`
- `requires_confirmation` → `PENDING`
- `requires_action` → `PENDING`
- `canceled` → `FAILED`

### From Stripe Invoice:
- `paid` → `COMPLETED`
- `open` → `PENDING`
- `draft` → `PENDING`
- `void` → `FAILED`
- `uncollectible` → `FAILED`

## Example Flow

```
1. Frontend calls: POST /api/v1/subscriptions/complete
   - customerId: cus_stripe123
   - planId: uuid-plan-456

2. Backend creates Stripe subscription with ERROR_IF_INCOMPLETE
   - Subscription activates automatically if payment method ready
   - Returns: sub_stripe789 with status "active"

3. Database updates:
   ✅ UserSubscription record created
   ✅ Payment record created with COMPLETED status
   ✅ Points awarded (500 points for Premium plan)
   ✅ User wallet updated (+500 points)

4. Response:
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "subscriptionId": "uuid-sub-123",
       "status": "ACTIVE",
       "stripeSubscriptionId": "sub_stripe789",
       "planName": "Premium"
     }
   }
```

## Database Consistency

The system ensures:
- ✅ Database subscription status matches Stripe status
- ✅ Payment records reflect actual Stripe payment state
- ✅ Points are only awarded once for active subscriptions
- ✅ All records are linked correctly via foreign keys
- ✅ Timestamps are accurate and consistent

## Error Handling

If payment record creation fails:
- Subscription record is still created
- Error is logged but doesn't block subscription creation
- Payment record can be created later via webhook

This ensures the database accurately reflects the Stripe subscription state and maintains data consistency!
